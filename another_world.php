<p class='pleft clearr clearls'>Play the game <a href='http://paxelated.com/anotherworld/' target='_blank'>here</a>. This was a thesis project, the aim of which was to create a browser-based point and click adventure game from the point of view of a refugee. It followed the main character's adventure as he flees his homeworld in search of a safer place to live. It was set on another world so as to remain detached from real world conflicts involving refugees.</p>
