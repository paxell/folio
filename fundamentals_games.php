<p class='pleft'>This design called for an interactive solution to an existing product, photocopiable game boards from the ‘Fundamentals’ series, which were played with dice and counters. A new look from the previous style was required. I decided that my visual cues where possible, would come from ‘real-world’ objects: counters and die had a 3D feel, the side module holding the game elements became a wooden tray, the calculator was inspired by one I had on my desk.</p>

<p class='pleft'>Working closely with a multimedia developer within a very tight time frame, we came up with a solution that allowed me to modify each parameter (number of counters etc) in XML to create over 40 individual games as required. The product page can be found <a href='http://www.origoeducation.com/number-case/' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
