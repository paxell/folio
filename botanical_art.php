<p class='pleft'>This freelance job required a branding update and a new CMS website. Drupal was used for the CMS implementation due to its flexibility and intuitive client interface. A new feature for the site was the addition of artists' profiles. Image galleries throughout helped to showcase the artists' striking work while the interface itself was kept simple.</p>

<p class='pleft'>For the logo, a simplified and cleaner version of their original logo was chosen. I created a style guide with outlines for the treatment of promotional materials and gallery signage as well as a stationery suite. The website can be found <a href='http://www.botanicalartqld.com.au' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>
