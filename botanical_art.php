<p class='pleft clearr clearls'>This freelance job required a branding update for the society and a redesign of their CMS website to refresh the site and attract new members. The website can be found <a href='http://www.botanicalartqld.com.au' target='_blank' title='Botanical Art Queensland website'>here</a>. Drupal was chosen to update the CMS due to its flexibility and intuitive client interface.</p>

<p class='pleft'>A new feature for the site was the addition of artists' profiles. Image galleries throughout helped to showcase the artists' striking work while the interface itself was kept simple. For the logo, a simplified and cleaner version of their original logo was chosen. I created a style guide with outlines for the treatment of promotional materials and gallery signage as well as a stationery suite.</p>
