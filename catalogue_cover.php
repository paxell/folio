<p class='pleft'>The catalogue cover changes twice a year and the brief is fairly open: there must be visual references to mathematics and education which always presents an interesting challenge. For this design I decided to reflect the more 'interactive' direction in which ORIGO's products were heading by using mathematical symbols, numbers, and logos from existing products and rendering them like icons.</p>

<div class='imgcont imgsm left'><img src='images/work/cover-2.jpg' alt='back cover'><div class='caption'>back cover design</div></div>
<p class='pleft'>The foreground elements were inspired by iphone apps, miniature icon design and laquered surfaces, while the background wisps were added to provide momentum and flow. These symbols were carried through the catalogue on title pages.</p>
